# simpleDOM

## Building from source

You need to have installed `grunt-cli` and `npm`, and have a stable Node.js version `>= 0.8.0` on your system. (See [gruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started))

Ensure you have `npm` installed and up-to-date by running `npm update -g npm`, and install grunt-cli using `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Then, while in the root simpleDOM directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
grunt
```

This will minify `src/simpledom.js` and run the appropriate tests on it.
